<h3><a href="https://github.com/kaw2k/static-site-compiler">SSC</a></h3>

<p>SSC is a simple "Static Site Compiler." It started out as a learning experience to learn NodeJS scripting and to explore how tools such as <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> function.</p>

<p>With SSC, you can import partials, templates in markdown and MustacheJS, execute "server side" javascript, as well as many other features.</p>

<!-- Colors -->
<h3><a href="https://github.com/kaw2k/colors">Colors</a></h3>

<p>Colors is a little tool to help manage your colors when you are starting a new web site, or any other project at that. It is very feature light (at the moment at least). The primary goal of this project was to make a single HTML page that uses local storage to save your colors.</p>

<p>The first iteration, which it is at presently, is a working version. It uses BackboneJS to make the interface and manage the business logic.</p>

<p>The second iteration will not be dependent on external libraries such as jQuery, and Backbone. Ultimatly, the goal is to get a very small HTML file with all its assets embedded directly in the DOM. This HTML file can then be copied over to each project when needed.</p>
