Hello, my name is Kevin Welcher and I am a web developer ;)

I have grown to truly love the web development community. If you have a project you are working on, or a question about javascript (or anything else in fact) I would love to help. 

Feel free to contact me for whatever reason at [kaw2k@virginia.edu](mailto:kaw2k@virginia.edu).
