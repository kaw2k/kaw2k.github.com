Functional programming has been making the rounds lately with a lot of press. I had watched [some awesome talks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3svKOdZijA) on functional Javascript, read the self proclaimed book [Functional Javascript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do) and in general was pretty excited to learn more about the topic. I proposed a meetup about functional Javascript hoping it would bring forward some nice discussions. As it turned out, it is still quite an emerging concept which resulted in me [warbling](http://www.meetup.com/Central-Virginia-Javascript-Enthusiasts-CVJSE/events/132911552/) for nearly and hour and a half!

If you are interested, here are the resources I used during the talk:

- [Demo Code](https://gist.github.com/kaw2k/6312261)
- [JSBin Playground](http://jsbin.com/umoK/1/edit)
- [Slide Deck](http://www.slideshare.net/kaw2/cv-js-26316409)
- Libraries: [ScoreUnder](https://github.com/loop-recur/scoreunder) and [LambdaJs](https://github.com/loop-recur/lambdajs)

It takes a community to learn and be productive. If you are interested in this kind of stuff, join us at #FunctionalJavascript on freenode!
