Hello, my name is Kevin Welcher and I am a web developer ;)

What am I doing? I am the lead developer and maintainer for [The Little Red Schoolhouse](http://redschoolhouse.org/drupal/welcome), dabble in video game development for [Chatter Sports](http://www.chattersportsllc.com/site/), and help Charlottesville locals make a digital presence with iOS and web applications.

I have grown to truly love the web development community. If you have a project you are working on, or a question about Javascript (or anything else in fact) I would love to help. 

Do not hesitate to contact me for whatever reason at [kaw2k@virginia.edu](mailto:kaw2k@virginia.edu).
