SSC is a simple static website compiler. I started this project when I wanted to make a simple, static website. I considered using [Jekyll](#), but I wanted something a bit simpler. I also considered using [Hammer](#), but not at the cost of spending money. I figured this was a good time to learn, and decided to role my own compiler.

So what does SSC do?
