After reading [Zach Holman's](http://zachholman.com/posts/inbox-zero-everything-zero/) article on his bare minimal todo list, I thought I would give it a shot. One thing that resonates with me above all else is messy desktops bug me to no end.

- Cron script to update labels
- Dropbox to sync todos
- File contents to take notes
